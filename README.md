<h2>Pearson Distributions</h2>
<h4>Types I, IV, VI</h4>

A simple python script for calculations of Pearson distribution types I, IV, VI, since they are not included in SciPy.


Stats.py contains CalcStats which can be used with any list of values (preferrably should be larger than 50 values).
main.py contains some basic code to calculate mode and mean values, and plot some "pretty" graphs for datasets in DATA.json.
